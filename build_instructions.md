# Live Cell Incubator
In the current setup there already is an incubator used. In the current incubator there are many openings for gas to escape and the material is wearing down (bending). The main aim for the new incubator is making it airtight as much as possible. The materials used should withstand 37°C and CO² gas.

![The old incubator](docs/images/image-20241218-143011.png)


The connectors of the old incubator will be used in the new incubator and the dimensions will be taken as a guide to draw up the new version. The old incubator is made of loose panels that will be bolted together. The old incubator is placed loosely on the platform. There are big openings to allow cables passing through. 
# Design  
The incubator has to fit on a platform that has two levels. On the top level a column is mounted which has the microscope attached to it. The old incubator sat on top of both levels of the platform, which left gaps between the top and bottom level. The new incubator will sit only on the bottom level en go over the second level completely.

![CAD view of the platform](docs/images/image-20241230-085243.png)

The new incubator will also consist of loose panels but now glued together as much as possible. The edge of the incubator will be covered with a neoprene foam strip to create a seal between the incubator and the platform. The cables will go through a cable gland. The panels of the incubator are made of black non-translucent PMMA (acrylic). The black PMMA does not let light through. 

![Isometric view of the incubator](docs/images/image-20241230-082630.png)

There are two ø6mm cables and four ø3mm cables coming from the right side and one ø4mm cable on the back. To let out the cables as airtight as possible the cable glands from the brand Icotek where used. These cable gland can be used without removing the connector.  

![Icotek cable gland](docs/images/icotek_Kabelverschraubung_QVT@2x-20241230-084739.png)

- Due to availability the IP54 versions where used, a better air-tightness is to be expected with the IP68 version. 
- During the installation there was an second cable that had to go out at the back. This cable is squeezed with the ø4mm cable in the cable gland. 

![Isometric view of the back with the grommets](docs/images/image-20241230-085031.png)

The four side panels and the top panel are glued together with ANGLOSOL CEMENT 700 (two part acrylic
adhesive) together. This will create a strong airtight bond. Between the side covers and the incubator is a rubber gasket (the gasket is glued to the incubator).  
After placing the incubator on the platform the tree bottom panels can be mounted and then bolted down with M3 bolts. Between the connecting surfaces of the panels and the incubators is a rubber gasket (the gasket is glued to the incubator). 
All edges of the incubator that make contact with the platform are covered with a foam rubber strip. 

![Assembly on the stage platform](docs/images/image-20241230-094100.png)

The incubator is secured to the second level of the platform by angle brackets. An extra strip is added to created a adjustable mounting position to fit alignment issues.

# Manufacturing 

![Inside view of mounted chamber](docs/images/image-20241230-100258.png)


All the PMMA plates are laser cut on the TROTEC Speedy 400. 2D outlines of the parts are exported as DXF files. The laser cutter cuts on the line of the dxf. This means that there is no offset compensation in the software. Dimensions of the dxf are adjusted to accommodate for the offset.  
![Parts cut on the laser cutting machine](docs/images/image-20241230-100033.png)

Before gluing the panels the M3 and M5 helicoil thread inserts are placed. The thread holes were kept smaller when cut. The holes for the threads are drilled to the correct size (M3=ø3,1, M5=ø5,2) using the smaller cut holes to position. Then the threads are tapped with the helicoil tap M3 and M5 and the helicoil are inserted.
Parts M205 and M211 need to be countersunk for cylindrical M3 bolt heads.    
The sides of parts M201 till M204 needs to have a +- 43 degree angle. Two 45° edges will make a 90° corner. With gluing the missing 2°/4° will be filled. The angles are cut on a table saw with the blade angled.     

![Sides cut on an angle](docs/images/image-20250110-100200.png)

![Gap for gluing](docs/images/image-20241230-111008.png)

To ensure a proper alignment with gluing two gluing molds are used. These are two plates that have the dimensions of the inside of the box. 

- The gluing molds should determine the dimensions of the incubator when gluing. Measure the gluing molds outer dimension to be sure that the dimensions are correct. 

![Tolerance of the gluing mold (top view)](docs/images/image-20241230-113040.png)

Two corresponding adjacent panels are placed next to each other and taped together on the long side. When taped the two panels can be placed in a 90° angle. This is also done with the other two panels. These two sets of panels can be placed together and checked with the gluing mold. 

![Corners that need to be glued (top view)](docs/images/image-20241230-113655.png)

![View of gluing mold fitted inside of the panels](docs/images/image-20241230-111615.png)
    
The panels will be glued in an 90° angle block, corner by corner. The side of the corners are taped off so the glue doesn’t run out between the plates, also on the ends of the plate. The corner of the first set of panels is then filled with glue and let to dry. This is repeated for the second set of panels.
![One set of panels ready to be filled with glue](docs/images/image-20241230-114451.png)

![Corner filled with glue](docs/images/39ab000b-c338-4eb8-aa70-828a0fd36c7d.jpg)
   
In the angle block together with the gluing mold the remaining corners can be glued. 
![Glued corners with the gluing mold and angle block](docs/images/ec99c783-34b9-42b3-9dd0-e6948b24c689.jpg)

After gluing any overflowing glue needs to be removed. 
![The incubator without the top panel](docs/images/f46a5b31-f7ce-4dc4-9627-75a59bcd5a22.jpg)
    
After gluing all the side panels the top panel can be glued. An even layer of glue is put on the top edge of the panels and the top panel is placed on top it. 
When all panels are glued together the holes on the bottom of the incubator are drilled (ø3,1mm) for M3 Helicoil thread inserts using two drill guides. The drill guides are aligned and clamped to the bottom of the incubator and the holes are drilled through the guides. Then the thread inserts are placed.
![Drill guides (blue and green)](docs/images/image-20241230-133323.png)
    
The right bottom panel consists of two plates that need to be glued together.

![](docs/images/image-20241230-134716.png)![]

 - Afterwards part M205 is made of 10mm thick plate instead of 8mm like the rest of the panels for extra clearance when installing. 

The rubber gaskets between the bolted parts are cut out of a NBR rubber plate using a water-jet cutting machine (cut with only water, no abrasive). The gaskets are glued to the incubator using Cyanolit.

- Instead of gluing the gasket, a gasket with on one side sticky tape can be used. Due to availability the standard sheet is used.  

![Incubator with gaskets (blue) glued](docs/images/image-20241230-134215.png)

Then the 2mm foam rubber is put on the bottom edges of the incubator. The foam rubber is sticky on one side. The foam rubber is put on the edge and cut to length with a sharp knife.
![Incubator with foam rubber (red)](docs/images/image-20241230-143134.png)
    
The foam rubber is also placed on the bottom covers. To accommodate for the 10mm plate two strips of 2mm foam are placed on top of each other on the flat panel.

# Assembly 
First the angle brackets and adjuster plate are mounted to the inside of the incubator. The bolts aren’t tightened completely so it can be move in position when placed on the platform.
![The brackets and adjuster plates mounted loosely](docs/images/image-20241230-150052.png)
   
Carefully the incubator is placed over the column and microscope onto the platform. Then the bottom covers M211 are fitted en bolted down. 
![](docs/images/image-20241231-084357.png)

![](docs/images/image-20241231-083728.png)
After the bottom covers are mounted the two adjuster plates can be bolted to the platform. The bolts of the brackets can now be tightened. 
![](docs/images/image-20241231-084520.png)

![](docs/images/image-20241231-085817.png)
    The last bottom cover can be mounted.
![](docs/images/image-20241231-084858.png)

The cables can be fitted through the cable glands and the cable glands can be place inside the incubator.
![](docs/images/image-20241231-085425.png)

![The brackets and adjuster plates mounted loosely](docs/images/image-20241231-085915.png)
The rest of the (air) connectors can be mounted to the incubator and the side covers can be placed.
